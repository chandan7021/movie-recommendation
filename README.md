ðŸŽ¬ CINEmatch Recommender: Engaging Users with Machine Learning
Welcome to the MovieFlix Recommender project! In todayâ€™s competitive OTT landscape, keeping viewers engaged with accurate movie suggestions is key to retaining users. This project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide context-aware movie recommendations, employing a vectorization method called Bag of Words (BoW).

Project Overview
Our goal is to enhance the MovieFlix experience by recommending movies that align with user preferences. Using a carefully designed fake dataset that mimics real-world data, we build a robust recommendation system suitable for any OTT platform, helping maintain usersâ€™ binge-watching habits.

Features

Bag of Words Vectorization: Converts movie descriptions into numerical representations that machines can process.

Cosine Similarity: Determines the similarity between movies to suggest titles with similar characteristics.

How It Works

Data Collection: Create a simulated dataset including movie titles, genres, descriptions, and other relevant details.

Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing stop words and applying stemming.

Vectorization: Transform text into vectors using the Bag of Words model.

Similarity Calculation: Calculate cosine similarity between movie vectors to identify similar movies.

Recommendation: Suggest movies based on the highest similarity scores.
